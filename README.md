# UCLA CS118 Project 3 (Simple Router)
======================================

For more detailed information about the project and starter code, refer to the [project description](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs118/project-3.html).

(For build dependencies, please refer to [`Vagrantfile`](Vagrantfile).)

## Makefile

The provided `Makefile` provides several targets, including to build `router` implementation.  The starter code includes only the framework to receive raw Ethernet frames and to send Ethernet frames to the desired interfaces.  Your job is to implement the routers logic.

Additionally, the `Makefile` a `clean` target, and `tarball` target to create the submission file as well.

You will need to modify the `Makefile` to add your userid for the `.tar.gz` turn-in at the top of the file.

## Academic Integrity Note

You are encouraged to host your code in private repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or other places.  At the same time, you are PROHIBITED to make your code for the class project public during the class or any time after the class.  If you do so, you will be violating academic honestly policy that you have signed, as well as the student code of conduct and be subject to serious sanctions.

## Known Limitations

When POX controller is restrated, the simpler router needs to be manually stopped and started again.

## Acknowledgement

This implementation is based on the original code for Stanford CS144 lab3 (https://bitbucket.org/cs144-1617/lab3).
